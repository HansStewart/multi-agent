WHAT IT DOES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  A sequential business-intelligence workflow that orchestrates
  specialized GPT-4o agents using CrewAI to produce a multi-section
  executive report from a single research topic.

  Each agent stage inherits the full output of the last — building
  layered, cumulative intelligence rather than isolated one-shot
  responses. The result is a coherent, multi-section executive report
  that reflects the full depth of the pipeline's analysis, not just
  what a single model pass could produce.

  Design pattern: sequential specialist agents consistently outperform
  a single undifferentiated reasoning step. Use cases: business research,
  strategic summaries, and high-context executive reporting.

BACKEND WORKFLOW — 4 STEPS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Step 01 — Topic intake
    Receives a research or analysis topic through the API.
    Builds the run context object used across the entire pipeline.
    Prepares the sequential execution chain for downstream agents.
    → Input: Research topic

  Step 02 — Sequential orchestration
    Uses CrewAI to coordinate sequential multi-agent execution.
    Each agent stage passes its full output forward as context.
    Builds layered intelligence rather than isolated one-shot outputs.
    → Intermediate: Cascading context chain

  Step 03 — Report assembly
    Aggregates insights from each specialized agent stage.
    Formats them into a consistent multi-section report architecture.
    Ensures continuity and narrative coherence across all sections.
    → Processing: Multi-stage synthesis

  Step 04 — Final delivery
    Outputs the completed report through the API in structured form.
    Supports research synthesis, strategic reviews, and executive
    briefing workflows.
    Creates a repeatable intelligence pipeline around one initial prompt.
    → Output: Executive intelligence report

CONTEXT MODEL
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Each stage inherits the full run context from all previous stages.
  This cumulative context model is what separates this system from a
  simple loop of independent GPT-4o calls — the intelligence compounds
  with each step rather than resetting.
